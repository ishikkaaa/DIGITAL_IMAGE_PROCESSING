# Image Conversion to Black and White with OpenCV

This project demonstrates how to convert both colored (RGB) and grayscale images to black and white using Python and OpenCV. The code performs the following tasks:

1. Converts a colored image to grayscale.
2. Converts the grayscale image to a black and white image using thresholding.
3. Converts an already grayscale image to a black and white image using thresholding.
